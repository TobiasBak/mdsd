Project for the course in Domain Specific Languages.

Hello! How are you? What? I can't hear you!


## PREREQUISITES
SOME HIGH VERSION OF NODE, I AM USING V23.8.0

## HOW TO USE LANGIUM
IF YOU HAVE EDITED GRAMMER IN `langium/er-dsl/src/language/goat-jh.langium` 
THEN YOU NEED TO RUN `npm run langium:generate` FOR IT TO UPDATE

IF YOU WANT TO TEST THE GRAMMAR, THEN YOU CAN RUN AND DEBUG ON A .JH FILE IN VSCODE!

IF YOU WANT TO RUN A .JH FILE YOU CAN DO `node langium/er-dsl/bin/cli.js generate ../test.JH`
